### A spring 2025 E177 Mechanical Design Final Project by Victoria Parizot, Ahlyssa Santillana, Alina Scholz, Sid Tchanyoum, Audrey Vo

## Introduction and Project Background
<!-- Introduction and Project Background: Provides clear and complete overview of the project -->
The goal for this project is to create a functional go-kart vehicle. The Ferrari GK is a go-kart built around a shopping cart frame and a 1 HP motor and includes functional steerage, breaking, and acceleration. The acceleration and direction that the vehicle propels is controlled by a PWM controller, and is powered by two 12V car batteries. An emergency stop function is also included in order to improve the safety of the vehicle.

## Requirements & Specifications
<!-- Requirements and Specifications (i.e., what does the design need to do?)
Highlights and justifies clear quantitative and qualitative requirements and specifications for the design -->

In order to make sure our go kart will work, our group defined a series of requirements and specifications. These requirements and specifications are motivated by safety and what we decided as critical in a functional go kart. These requirements and specifications assume that the user is within the weight constraint and all limbs are within the bounds of the cart. A list of those details is below:

### Requirements
- Must be safe to use for user
- Must include steering wheel and be steerable by user
- Must include a working brake
- Must be powered with motor
- Must include speed control
- Must be able to move a 200lb user

### Specifications
- The cart must be able to safely transport a user of 200lbs at least 10 ft, with the ability to accelerate at 1m/s^2 up to 5 mph. 
- Implement functional steerage, controlled by a steering wheel, on the front wheels with a spindle assembly. 
- Implement functional braking on the rear wheels 
<!-- - Achieve a speed of at least 5 MPH for a 200 lb user -->


## Design Features of Main Subsystems
Our go kart consists of four critical subsystems: steerage, frame, braking, and motor. These subsystems are critical in allowing the user to control the go kart. The steerage subsystem allows the users to control the direction of the vehicle. The brake and motor subsytem allows the user to contol their speed. The frame is critical in holding the user, and combining all the other subsystems.

## Future Work
<!-- Presents clear and specific directions for future work -->
During the engineering process, there were a few design decisions the team made due to budget and time constraints. In order to improve our current vehicle, we would want to improve the overall stability of the frame to support users of greater weight by replacing our 80-20 frame with steel. In addition, we would want to attempt to increase the speed of the vehicle by increasing the input voltage of the motor with higher voltage batteries. We would also want to improve user comfort by using a larger shopping cart, and potentially including a seat. Finally, in future iterations we would want to make the steering differential, which would allow the vehicle to adjust to speed changes as it is making turns. 


## Conclusion
<!-- Clearly summarizes key takeaways from project and recommendations for future work -->

Overall, our team was able to succesfully build a vehicle that can safely transport a 200 pound user up to 5mph and 1 m/s^2 of acceleration. In addition, the vehicle contains a functional steering system and speed control that allows the user to moderate the vehicle's movement with ease. Throughout this project, the team applied our analysis skills to evaluate our design, as well as gained technical skills in welding, machining, and CADing our design. The low-resolution prototypes and iterative design process was immensly helpful for motivating design decisions. 

We are excited about the outcome of our project, and look forward to riding it around Harvey Mudd's campus!

<!-- Overall building the lathe was an incredibly fun and informative project. We had the opportunity to apply many of the analysis skills we learned about in mechanical design and the machine shop, as well as learn more in-depth analysis, part selection, machining, and project management skills. We had to apply fatigue, bolt, gear, and pulley analysis over the course of our project. We also had to learn how to do power analysis to compare our lathe with commercial products.  We also had the opportunity to learn CNC turning to make our pulley and members of the group made a keyway and keyseat successfully. Finally, we learned some important estimation skills that saved us a lot of time for analysis. We calculated the stresses and factors of safety for the worst loading cases so that we could verify the structural integrity of our parts without needing to do a more complex analysis.  -->

<!-- If we were to do the project again, there are a handful of details we would change. As mentioned earlier, it would have been nice if we had purchased a longer belt and a more rigid tailstock (although we were unsure of our budget constraints at the time). We also would have chosen to use a slightly smaller shaft for our spindle. Ultimately, we were constrained by the threaded feature on the chuck, but we still could have used a 0.75" aluminum shaft instead of a 1" aluminum shaft. We realized after purchasing our shaft that our initial fatigue analysis was incorrect and that a 0.75" shaft would have had a sufficient factor of safety.  -->
