## Abstract
The project that our team will be working on is building a functional go-kart vehicle. Parts of the design that are in scope are the functional 4-wheel steering system, a brake, and a motorized power supply. Parts that are out of scope are the creation of a motor, no motion in reverse, or the inclusion of headlights, seatbelts, or airbags. Aerodynamics and designing for optimal weight distribution will also not be considered in the design process.
