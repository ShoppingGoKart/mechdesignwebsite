The Ferrari GK is a go-kart built around a shopping cart frame and a 1 HP motor and includes functional steerage, breaking, and acceleration. The acceleration and direction that the vehicle propels is controlled by a PWM controller, and is powered by two 12V car batteries. An emergency stop function is also included in order to improve the safety of the vehicle."

In order to improve our current vehicle, we would want to improve the overall stability of the frame to support users of greater weight by replacing our 80-20 frame with steel. In addition, we would want to attempt to increase the speed of the vehicle by increasing the input voltage of the motor with higher voltage batteries. We would also want to improve user comfort by using a larger shopping cart, and potentially including a seat. Finally, in future iterations we would want to make the steering differential, which would allow the vehicle to adjust to speed changes as it is making turns."

In addition, the vehicle contains a functional steering system and speed control that allows the user to moderate the vehicleâ€™s movement with ease. Throughout this project, the team applied our analysis skills to evaluate our design, as well as gained technical skills in welding, machining, and CADing our design. The low-resolution prototypes and iterative design process was immensly helpful for motivating design decisions.\nWe are excited about the outcome of our project, and look forward to riding it around Harvey Muddâ€™s campus!"

In order to obtain enough torque to move the entire vehicle and user, a gear ratio of 6.5 was used, where the driving sprocket has 10 teeth and the sprocket driving the back axle has 65 teeth. A 35 chain was used to connect the two sprockets, and kept at a pretension. The back axle consisted of a 5/8 inch shaft that connected the 26 tooth sprocket, two block bearings mounted to an aluminum plate, and the two back wheels. The aluminum plateâ€™s purpose is to mount the back axle system to the frame of the vehicle and also house the batteries. Keyhole slots and hose clamps were then used to fixture the sprockets and wheels in place so that they would rotate relative to the shaft."
