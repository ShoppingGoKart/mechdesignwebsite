These requirements and specifications are motivated by safety and what we decided as critical in a functional go kart. A list of those details is below:\n\nRequirements\n\nMust be safe to use for user\nMust be steerable by user\nMust include a working brake\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nSafely Transport a user of 200lbs at least 10 ft, with the ability to accelerate at 1m/s^2 up to 5 mph.\nImplement functional steerage, controlled by a steering wheel, on the front wheels with a spindle assembly.\nImplement functional braking on the rear wheels\nAchieve a speed of at least 5 MPH for a 200 lb user"

    "text": "Design Features of Main Subsystems\nOur go kart consists of four critical subsystems: steerage, frame, braking, and motor. These subsystems are critical in allowing the user to control the go kart. The steerage subsystem allows the users to control the direction of the vehicle. The brake and motor subsytem allows the user to contol their speed. The frame is critical in holding the user, and combining all the other subsystems.\nRead more about sub systems here"

The user will rotate the steering wheel, which in turn will rotate the steering column and Pitman arm. The Pitman arm is a shaft that translates rotary or angular movement into linear movement and is used in our steering subsystems to pivot the wheels. The wheels will be on a spindle on the front axle and controlled by the tie rods controlled by the Pitman arm. When designing this steering subsystem, we have to ensure that wheels will remain parallel, be wary of binding, and add stops to prevent involuntary motions."
