    "text": "Frame Subsystem\nThe frame is built using a shopping cart and 80/20. The legs of the shopping cart was removed with an angle grinder, allowing the cart to be closer to the ground. This was desired as a lower center of mass improves stability (less chance of tipping over), handling, and safety. The back of the shopping cart was extended to improve user comfort. The shopping cart provided us a base to design the rest of the system around. The grid cart made it easy to attatch wiring, the 80/20, and steering bearing. Moreover, the cage around the user adds a level of safety.\nOne quantitative decision made was the material choice and frame dimensions in order to meet the specifications of safely moving a 200 pound user, meaning that the frame had to support the static and dynamic load from the user’s weight. An 80-20 frame was readily available to prototype with, and following yield and deflection analysis, we decided to move forward with 80-20 for the final build given that we expect to be two orders of magnitude away from yielding the 80-20.\n\n\n\nShopping cart before modifications\n\n\nOriginally, we had debated welding a steel frame for the go kart as this is what we had seen for most online DIY go kart builds. However, we opted to use an 80/20 base under the shopping cart due to its availability and modularity. An online blog showed the feasibility, and encouraged us to move foward with the analysis and design. Moreover, the team was able to acquire 80-20 from a scrapped clinic prototype. The modularity and availablity was helpful in the prototyping stage, allowing each subteam to easily visualize changes. Moreover, the modularity and fastening ability helped connect all subsystems together. We used two layers of 80/20 in the frame for added strength. The 80/20 frame was connected to the shopping cart with industrial stength zipties.\n\n\n\nCompleted Cart"

The braking line will be applied to both of the wheels. To create this the team welded three steel pipes together to cover the width of the of the frame and reach all the way to the front of the cart. Then two aluminum “brake pads” were welded on to steel pipe and aligned with the two back wheels. Once the lever is raised by the rider the brake pads then come in contact with the wheels and stop the rotation of the wheels. On top of a physical break there are two other ways to stop the kart. One is with the red E-STOP that when pushed will automatically cut power to the power. The other is with the potentiometer which when put at its lowest value will also slow down the kart.\n\n\n\nBrake Subsystem"

    "text": "Motor Subsystem\nFor the motor system, we will have a single motor driving both of the back wheels. It will use gears to transmit power and sit in the back of our GoKart. In order to obtain enough torque to move the entire vehicle and user at a speed of 5mph, a gear ratio of 6.5 was used, where the driving sprocket has 10 teeth and the sprocket driving the back axle has 65 teeth. A 35 chain was used to connect the two sprockets, and kept at a pretension. The back axle consisted of a 5/8 inch shaft that connected the 26 tooth sprocket, two block bearings mounted to an aluminum plate, and the two back wheels. The aluminum plate’s purpose is to mount the back axle system to the frame of the vehicle and also house the batteries. Keyhole slots and hose clamps were then used to fixture the sprockets and wheels in place so that they would rotate relative to the shaft.\nOne quantitative decision made was the number of teeth per sprocket used in the motor subsystem in order to meet the specifications of moving a 200 pound user up to 5mph. After our analysis, a 6.5 gear ratio was intentionally achieved in order to meet these requirements.\n\n\n\nCompleted Motor Subsystem"

    "section": "PWM Control",
    "text": "PWM Control\nTo give the user more control of the motor, the team used a Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Contoller. This controller uses a potentiometer to inform the duty cycle, reads the duty cycle in a form of a percentage on a seven-segment display, and includes a switch to turn on the motor, run the motor in reverse, and turn off the motor. PWM speed control works by driving the motor with a series of fast on and off pulses with variable duty cycle. The duty cycle informs the fraction of time the motor is on versus off, therby controlling the speed the motor with rotate.\nThe team opted for this design as it would require minimal electrical work to integrate with our system, allowing us to focus on the mechanical design of our system. Originally, we had thought to use a potentiometer as part of a voltage divider circuit between the battery and motor. However the large voltage would require a physically large (and expensive) potentiometer and the large current needs of the motor could not be met with a voltage divider. Thus, we switched to a more common solution for motor speed control – a PWM controller. The specific Contoller choosen is compatible with DC voltages between 10 to 55V and a maximum current of 60A. As we use 24V and have a current below the maximum, this controller is applicable for our design.\nWe are ultimately happy with the PWM control as it allows the user to control the speed and allows for the motor to run in reverse by inverting the voltage, which was one of our stretch goals. To ensure the safety of our design, we also integrated an E-STOP in our design that would cut the power to the motor when pressed. This E-STOP was wired in series between the battery and PWM Controller.\n\n\n\nPWM Interface Dashboard with E-Stop"

    "text": "Back Shaft Analysis\n\nTorsional Stress\nWe can first draw a FBD of the torsional stresses acting on the shaft due to the tension of the chain acting on the sprocket. From our calculations above, we know that the torque is expected to be 13.25 lb-ft due to the gear ratio implemented. Thus, we need to find the 2 forces acting on the sprocket due to the chain.\n\\(F_1\\) is tension, while \\(F_2\\) is in slack due to how the chains are moving relative to each other. Thus, we can assume \\(F_2 = 0\\), and solve for \\(F_1\\) using the known torque value.\n\n\n\nBack Shaft Force Calculations\n\n\nWe can now also find the shear stress acting on the back shaft and compare it to the tensile strength of the steel we are using.\n\n\n\nShear Stress on Back Shaft Calculations\n\n\nCarbon steel has a tensile strength between 400-700 MPa, and the stress expected to act on our shaft is significantly less than that. Thus, our back shaft should be able to withstand the shear and torsional stress it undergoes.\n\n\nBending Stress and Deflection of Back Axle\nWe then wanted to determine the deflection and bending stress that the back axle experiences. We could simplify the system as a simply supported beam with 2 point loads (where the bearings attach to the frame of the vehicle). Since our entire vehicle is 300 pounds, we assumed that the back of the vehicle will hold roughly half of that weight (~150 pounds). Thus, each point load will hold about 75 pounds assuming an equal distribution across the shaft.\n\n\n\nMaximum Deflection of Back Shaft Calculations\n\n\nThe maximum deflection calculated located in the center of the shaft is 0.4 inches, which is greater than what we expected and saw in our system as it was performing.\nWe could find the maximum bending stress by finding the maximum moment.\n\n\n\nMaximum Bending Stress of Back Shaft Calculations\n\n\nThe bending stress of 172.37 MPa was less than the yield stress of structural steel, and thus will not yield under the expected load.\n\n\nBearings Lifetime Evaluation\nIn order to find the lifetime of the back axle bearings, we can model the bearings as a simply supported theme with 2 point loads acting on the bearings from the weight of the vehicle similar to how we modeled the system to solve for bending stress.\nThis allows us to find the force of the bearings and the power outputted by the shaft.\n\n\n\nBack Shaft Bearings Force and Power Calculations\n\n\nThe power that the shaft outputs is 0.44 hp, which is within the capacity of our physical motor and seems reasonable to our expectations of its performance.\nWe can now find the lifetime of the bearings by using the values calculated above along with additional values found from the Block Bearing’s specification sheet.\n\n\n\nBack Shaft Bearings Lifetime Calculations\n\n\nThe lifetime of the bearings is \\(6.36 * 10^{13}\\), which is a very long lifetime for our vehicle. Thus, the bearings chosen are appropriate for it use."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nOverall, our team was able to succesfully build a vehicle that can safely transport a 200 pound user up to 5mph with 1 m/s^2 of acceleration. In addition, the vehicle contains a functional steering system and speed control that allows the user to moderate the vehicle’s movement with ease.\nThroughout this project, the team grew comfortable with vehicle design – learning common ways go-karts implement steering and how to integrate an electrical design. Beyond experience with vehicle design, the team applied our analysis skills to evaluate our design, getting experience with comparing design options and identifying potential areas of failure. This includes throught exercises on material design, fastners, and chain and sprocket design. The team also gained technical skills – improving our machining skills and learning the MIG weld. The practice of CADing our entire system familiarized ourselves with a CAD workflow and more complex SolidWorks functionalities. Moreover, this project provided more experience in project management and practice in the iterative design process.\nIf we were to do this project again, there are a handful of changes we would make as detailed above. We would consider steel for the frame, use a larger shopping cart, and relook at steerage design. As we conclude our project we have a better idea of how all these subsystems work together. If we were to design another vehicle or mechanical project in the future, our experiences will be immensely helpful in the design process.\nWe are excited about the outcome of our project, and look forward to riding it around Harvey Mudd’s campus!"
